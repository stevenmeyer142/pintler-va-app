## Upload to AWS HealthLake from VA App using AWS Amplify

This repository contains a client/server app that uploads VA patient records to AWS HealthLake.
This is an AWS Amplify project.

## Overview

The app uses a React frontend and multiple backend lambdas written in TypeScript.

The frontend code is in the folder "frontend".

The backend code is in the folders "amplify/functions" and "amplify/custom/va-access"

## VA access setup.

The app is currently configured to use the VA patient sandbox database.

Sandbox access must be requested and the correct redirect URL must be supplied.
[VA Patient Health Sandbox Access](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/patient-health/sandbox-access)

The redirect url is prefixed with the Gateway URL for the VA Access serverless lambda. This can be found in the file "amplify_outputs.json" with the key "custom.gatewayURL". The file "amplify_outputs.json" is generated by the Amplify sandbox.

The redirect url takes the form `${gatewayURL}auth/cb`

The client_id and client_secret for VA Access are stored in the AWS Secrets Manager. These must be entered after requesting accessing.

The host prefix is used to designate a unique secret name as shown in the following example.

Gateway url - https://czy03iz038.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Secret name "dev/czy03iz038/va_client"
The secret must contain the keys- client_id and client_secret.

The code that uses the secrets can be found in the file "amplify/custom/va-access/src/app_backend.ts"
